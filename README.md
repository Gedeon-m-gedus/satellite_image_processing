Satellite mapping is way easier than traditional cartographic methods, but still, the main challenge is in recognizing particular objects in the image, like roads, buildings and landmarks. Getting up-to-date information about roadblocks and threats is even more essential. And thatâ€™s where machine learning-based solutions come into play.
